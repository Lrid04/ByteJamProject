      It was a dreary cold November night when you got home 
      from work. Tired and freezing as you walked into your house, 
      which was not much warmer than the outside. It was dark 
      inside, you shuffled off the living room to spend your time 
      before you inevitably had to return to work in the morning. 
      Had to find something fun to do, maybe read a book before 
      you have your dinner. 
      <br />
      You plopped down in your armchair with a sigh, reaching over 
      to fumble with a lamp on the table next to you and twisting 
      the knob, and filling the room with light. When you looked back 
      from the lamp, you jumped not expecting what was sitting before 
      you, something that was not usually in your living room. Where 
      could this have come from? You stood up walking closer to 
      examine the object.
      <br />
      It was one of those ‘TVs’ that everybody had started to buy, 
      boxes with screens that could display an image. You thought it 
      was a very impressive concept, but you could never buy one for 
      yourself. It was too expensive—hell, they were like $100! So how 
      did this possibly end up in your living room? You certainly didn’t 
      buy it.
      <br />
      On top of the set was a remote, certainly not like the ones 
      you’ve seen before from other’s TV’s.
      <br />
      Why was this here? You lived alone, just you in this house, you 
      certainly didn’t sleep buy a TV! Where did it come from? It’s 
      not like you could complain much, the strange TV was free. At 
      least it was something to do.
      <br />
      Why not try it?
      <br />
      You picked up the remote, a bulky metal clicker with numbered 
      buttons. Cold against your hand, you stare at the TV a weird 
      feeling building in your chest. This all was very strange, but 
      your curiosity was getting the best of you. You took a seat in 
      your armchair, you stared at the remote for a bit, it weighed 
      heavily on your mind. You had to find out what this was.
      <br />
      So holding your breath you pressed the button.
